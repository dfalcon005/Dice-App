# Dice-App
Dice rolling simulator iOS application.

I purchased a swift and iOS app development course on Udemy because I was interested in learning how the application I use on my phone 
everyday were created. 

One of the first modules in this course was learning how to make a application using good design. This application was a dice 
rolling simulator. This application used 6 different images that represented each face on a dice. It displayed to different dice
and once roll button was pressed it would use a randomization function to show a random image out of the 6 images on each of the dice.

I really enjoyed making this, but I felt like it was missing something. I thought it was very limiting that the options for number of dice
was very limited. So I decided to create a drop down menu that allows you to choose the number of dice you want to use between 1 and 4. 

Creating this application taught me good UI design and how to add contraints to different components. I also learned cool tricks such as
hiding UI elements when creating the drop down menu and hiding the dice that are not being used. I think this app was a great introduction
to using swift and xcode and really peaked my interest in mobile applications.
